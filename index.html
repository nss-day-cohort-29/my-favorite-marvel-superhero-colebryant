        <p>Although Thor wasn't originally my favorite superhero in the MCU, he has become my favorite as his story
            has progressed. He has developed an interesting backstory with his family in Asgard and his sense of humor
            has grown over time, especially by Thor: Ragnarok. I also like Thor a lot because out of many of the Marvel 
            superheroes, he possesses innate super powers and doesn't require a suit of armor. By Infinity War, he doesn't
            even need a hammer in order to be an effective fighter. Overall, his progression as a superhero was excellent and 
            that is why Thor is my favorite.</p>
